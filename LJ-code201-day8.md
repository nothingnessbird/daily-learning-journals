#LJ Code 201 - Day 8

Today was more frustrating than yesterday. I feel a little swamped, and I'm getting behind on the reading discussions. I need to go back and fix some old code, and it's getting a lot harder to keep up. I keep getting feedback that I'm doing well, but I feel overwhelmed and like I will fall behind.
