#LJ Code 201 - Day 3

GAHHHHHHHH

I hate css I hate css I hate css
I never want to touch the stuff.


OKAY

I got that out of my system. CSS doesn't make much intuitive sense to me. I'm trying to understand it but it just...sucks. I know I'll get there but for right now I'm just thoroughly frustrated.

The javascript is going okay, but also I am annoyed that .parseInt isn't a thing. I feel pretty overwhelmed, but also at least with the javascript my head doesn't hurt and I'm having fun. My life is in shambles, but as long as I'm here I feel a lot better. I do feel like the work just piles and piles and piles and maybe I'm way too slow at this stuff....

I spent too much time on the css and it still sucks, and now I'm going to be up all night with the javascript and I won't be able to do the stretch. lesson learned.


ETA:
it's parseInt().....I did figure that out last night but it took me way too long.
