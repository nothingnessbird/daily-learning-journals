#LJ Code 201 - Day 17

Today was really good, better than yesterday. We finished the basic functionality and deployed to gh pages. I also had some fun with pictures today; I edited and added all the pictures for our matches, and then also (with help from my partner), designed and made a vector image for our fixed foreground. The website looks great with the dots and I think it will be lovely.
