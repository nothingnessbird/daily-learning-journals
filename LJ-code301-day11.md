#LJ Code 301 - Day 11

I feel so behind and beat down. The code wars is great, but I got SO LOST when I looked at what I needed to do to my portfolio for day 10... And even after finishing that (with a lot of help) I feel really lost about how to refactor it into the pagejs stuff for yesterday. I did a little bit but I'm going to be behind still. I'm feeling a lot of the time like I have no idea what I'm even supposed to be doing.
