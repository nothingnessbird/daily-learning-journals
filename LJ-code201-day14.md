#LJ Code 201 - Day 14

I felt awful and sick today, and it really impacted my ability to work. I fell during lunch, and then was sick all afternoon, and the pain was a huge drain on my ability to focus. I am glad that I am in the process of trying to figure out the sickness, and of figuring out the right accommodations for pain and mobility. I am also glad it is almost the weekend.
