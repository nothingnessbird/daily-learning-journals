#LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Pair programming is the best! I'm sure it's going to get really frustrating later, but for right now I'm loving it. I didn't get bogged down on little details, I didn't sit and bang my head on the wall forgetting the 15 minute rule, I had this whole other brain to access. I ean, I also wasn't allowed to touch my code at all...which was interesting and frustrating and will definitely take some getting used to, but so far I really just like it a lot. I get why this is the industry standard.

I got so much more done in so much less time, and I think I'll make it home before 10pm tonight! On that note...I'm SIGNING OFF!
