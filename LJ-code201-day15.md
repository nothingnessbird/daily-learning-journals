#LJ Code 201 - Day 15

WOOO! Done with classes, on to projects. Got a lot more done on order-form and had great discussions with my team for projects week. I'm really stoked about starting our project and I think it will be a good one, and that we have a great team. I'm a little worried about the test for 301, but hopefully that's just anxiety.
