#LJ Code 201 - Day 20

DONE WITH CODE 201!

What a ride. I have learned so much in the last 4 weeks. I look forward to the next class, and learning even more. I have to trust my brain won't actually burst from too much knowledge being crammed in there at once (luckily, in spite on the feeling, neuroscience still applies). I am very ready for a little time off to let what I learned coalesce, though I have no plans to spend the next week *not* coding. I can't wait to get that 301 acceptance email and start on the prework!
