#LJ Code 301 - Day 3

Yesterday was great! Didn't get my learning journal done because I was too busy making great networking connections. I had registered for the Vet Tech Summit, so after class I attended that, and got several business cards I plan on following up with and adding on LinkedIn. I wish my LinkedIn was nicer already, but I'm sure there are good guides for how to do that. I'm really glad I took the opportunity to network.

That said, I also managed to absorb a lot of the class info, and doing the portfolio and lab assignments were not "easy," but were at least not completely foreign, even though I waited til the next day. All in all a solid day.
