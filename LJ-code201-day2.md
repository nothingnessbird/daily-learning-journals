#LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Wow! I know they said it was going to be, but this is already super intense. I feel like I'm going to feel behind literally the entire time, so I hope I'll be able to tell if (hopefully never) I ever actually get to that point.

I hope I'm not asking too many questions. I feel like I ask a ton... I'd like to think I'm inside of the hump of the bellcurve for preparedness/comprehension/engagement etc, but I seem to have more questions. Maybe I have lower inhibition for asking.
