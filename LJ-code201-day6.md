#LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Today's logic was really fun! I wish I could just do that all day. (And more and more complex). The HTML and CSS took me forever and I'm starting to hate them I feel like I'm working hard and going above and beyond on the javascript, but the extra credit and stuff so far has been for CSS. Also, I HATED that the site didn't have a problem domain for the appearance at all. That's horrible and I hate design. I'm colorblind, I have no visual imagination, and design isn't something that interests me at all. I will be much happier when I'm no longer dealing with the look/design side of things. I'm getting frustrated by the fact that I need most of my help with the HTML/CSS part, but if I ask for that help I just get pushed off until the logic is done. I get that the logic is harder for most, but for me it's the exact opposite. I need more help with the HTML/CSS.
