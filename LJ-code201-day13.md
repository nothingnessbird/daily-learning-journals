#LJ Code 201 - Day 13

Today was very enriching. Working with Marco for pair programming was a lot of fun and also helped me gain a lot of PCK (pedagogical and content knowledge). We worked through SO MUCH code in our allotted time, and then continued to work after. It was awesome and even though it can be frustrating not to just handle your own code, having the extra pair of eyes and the extra brain to bounce things off of makes it well worth it.
