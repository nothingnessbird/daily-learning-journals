#LJ Code 201 - Day 11

Today was the first day that the logic felt out of range and I wasn't sure how to approach the problem. It was frustrating, but I could feel myself stretching and growing as I figured out (with help) how to get what I wanted. I really enjoyed it once I got a better handle on what I was actually trying to do. I am beyond grateful there isn't a lot of CSS today.
