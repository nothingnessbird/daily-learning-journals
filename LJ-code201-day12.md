#LJ Code 201 - Day 12

Today was a great day. In spite of missing code review, I was able to quickly get my data into a graph and even add some nice functionality. I had a lovely time doing this, and am enjoying this assignment a lot..for now. Tomorrow is CSS and stuff and I'm not looking forward to that.
