#LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Welp, this is the hardest week. No kidding. I'm getting so overwhelmed by the html and css, as well as having to update older assignments. I think I did everything I need to for right now, and I am going to finally get a little sleep if I can. It hasn't helped that I've been really sick, and a bunch of different factors in my life are really complicated and need attention I can't give them and still get my work done. At least I can hopefully look forward to being in a better place for 301.
