#LJ Code 301 - Day 6

In spite of feeling like I don't understand this stuff, and never having a clear idea of why doing certain things works, I seem to be correctly "guessing" (what it feels like) what the correct things to put in the code are. But I'm not to the point where I know what my next step is, yet. Once I know my next step I seem to be doing okay at implementing it. Hopefully this stuff starts to make more sense to me soon.
