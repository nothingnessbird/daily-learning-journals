#LJ Code 201 - Day 5

WHOA.

Learned a ton today. And I feel a lot better about how much of a handle I've got on the javascript. I still feel really lost about CSS, but I plan on spending weekend time on that. I really hope I can get a better feel for git over the weekend as well. I showed my about me page to a friend who works at intel and he thought it looked really cool! That was really awesome positive reinforcement, even though I'm pretty sure it looks like garbage right now. I will make it better. I'm glad I already made the github page so I can show it to people.

OH! So today is my friend Chris Hacking's birthday, which I notices because now that it's the weekend I finally looked at facebook. And instead of just telling him happy birthday, I wrote a function to tell him (or anyone) happy birthday (that only applies this week, but I could easily amend the text)! Here it is, called for Chris:

      function hatchingDay (firstName,lastName,age,myName) {
        var older = parseInt(age) + 1;
        return 'Happy freaking birthday, ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName + '! Hard to believe you\'re ' + age + ' already! And next year you\'ll be ' + older + '! Now that\'s old! I know my code is still really simple, but it\'s only week one. I\'ll get there (and I\'m sure you\'ll help). I hope your day is as wonderful as can be! Love, ' + myName;
      }

      hatchingDay('Chris','Hacking',31,'Kinley');

Anyway, I thought it was pretty cool, a) that my first thought was that I could write a program, and b) that my program worked (I tested it).
