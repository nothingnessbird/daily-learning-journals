#LJ Code 201 - Day 10

So ready for this weekend. Today's lab was excruciating for me once we got to the CSS. The HTML was fine enough, but the CSS was really just something I never want to touch if I can help it, once I leave cf. You really couldn't pay me enough to do web design for a living. It's straight anathema for me. I will look at the CSS extras assignment, and see if I have time to do any of it, but honestly I don't know if practice will make me hate it any less. For right now I'm just happy to have some time to rest.
