#LJ Code 301 - Day 2

Welp, today was frustrating. It's already a TON more work, and I have to find my JS book (we're moving and everything is in disarray). I really am not fond of this portfolio assignment, though I'm enjoying the labs. I just hate the design aspect, mostly. Finished the pair pab for the day, at least. Code wars is having server issues, so even though my code works (I tested it), I can't turn it in yet. Putting my code here so I don't lose it.


```language-javascript
  function disemvowel (str) {
    return str.replace(/[aeiou]/ig,'')
  };
```
